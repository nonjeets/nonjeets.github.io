# SEEDING IS A SURPRISE TIME FRAME - PREVENTING INSTANT SELLS - GIVING THE PROJECT A REAL SHOT

# Why was this built?
Simple - Protecting and safeguarding legitimate developers and Projects  
The scale of fraud happening daily is sickening

# How will you protect us?
* Dev joins us with his idea.
* We create the TG Group sub link
* We create the Twitter sub link
* We create a sub domain in GitHub for pointing to proper URL`s on Site and Socials
* We launch and hold the Dev wallet.
* We pay the Ray seeding.
* We transfer the DEV wallet to the Developer 4 hours after DEX launch.

All these safe guards ensure that even if the DEV leaves the project it can continue with a CTO

# Now that you are here, we are getting our coin of the ground.

After seeding it is essential that you hold while the bots buy and sell. They move on after 15 Minutes.
Seeding takes 3 - 180 Minutes 

We will also tweet out good projects that fell victim to massive dumps from nasty traders. If they are alive and building, we will support them.

As we take this journey please be patient we will get a TG channel and all the bells and whistles.
We want this as natural as possible creating stable seeding and value retention for you.

Safe trading - always book your initial as profit.
Let`s see if we can get this done.
