Dev will sell 25% SEND at between 70-80% (Payment for DEX and Trend)

# Why was this built?
Simple - Protecting and safeguarding legitimate developers and Projects  
The scale of fraud happening daily is sickening

# How will you protect us?
1.1 Dev joins us with his idea.

1.2 We launch and hold the dev wallet.

1.3 We pay the Ray seeding.

We hand over the wallets and dev coins 1 hour after seeding is done.

Now that you are here, we are getting our coin of the ground.

After seeding it is essential that you hold while the bots buy and sell. They move on after 15 Minutes.
Seeding takes 1 - 30 Minutes 

We will also tweet out good projects that fell victim to massive dumps from nasty traders. If they are alive and building, we will support them.

As we take this journey please be patient we will get a TG channel and all the bells and whistles.
We want this as natural as possible creating stable seeding and value retention for you.

Safe trading always take your initial as profit.
Let`s see if we can get this done.
